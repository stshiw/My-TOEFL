## Role of Play in Development
>近来，关于生物进化的研究备受争论。达尔文的原著论文，并且得到了逐渐进化论者支持的论点，表明生物是持续并且缓慢的进行在小变量中进化的。这些变化**是普遍的**,但是在短期的当时观察中是无法察觉的。并且表明这些变化通常被掩藏在不可计数的不完美化石记录的**断层**中。渐变主义强调缓慢的变化，是一个广泛被接受的说法。一次一次的再教科书中被反复提到。在20世纪早期前，在渐变主义的偏爱中，对于进化速度这个问题的回答已经满足了绝大多数生物学家。

>有时候当新的证据被发现，或者机遇已有的证据而被提出的新的论证来到的大家的眼前，那些已有定论的问题必须被重新开启。1972年古生物学者JG和NE以一个对立的观点向传统发起了挑战，这就是PE假说。这个假说认为生物进化并非是基于漫长的过渡，而可以说是忽然之间就进化成了新的物种。这些快速进化的片段被相对漫长的静止时段而分离，在这个时段中一种生物可能一点也不会变化。

>这个PE理论想要解释一个令人好奇的化石记录特征，这是一个几个世纪以来的古生物学者们都非常熟悉但是却一直被忽略的特征。许多物种在几百万年的过程中都保持不变，基于达尔文的持续变化模型来看，这个情况非常奇怪。被渐变主义预言存在的中间媒介化石形态一直都没有被找到。在许多存有蛤和珊瑚的地方，他们在非常厚的地质断层**（岩石层）**中都没有发生根本的变化，只是突然就被新的不同的物种所替代。

>北美马的进化曾经在传统教科书中以渐变进化理论的佐证出现。现在这个例子也为PE理论提供了有力的证据。一个令人信服的5千万年的现代马祖先的序列，变得越来越大，具有更加复杂的牙齿，更长的脸以及更加突出的中趾，看起来为达尔文的渐变进化论点提供了强有力的支持。但是最近对于这些化石的研究揭示了一个不同的故事。马的进化是一个不连续的过程，每个阶段都在几百万年中保持基本不变，之后被一个明显不同的新模型替代。比如**四趾E在3趾M之前（E preceded M)**。但是北美马的化石证据表明了两者间不平稳不平摊的过渡。如果进化是一个连续并且渐变的过程，那么人们应该看到的是每段时间都会存在的细微变化。

>很难设想主要变化会怎么在短时间内发生，但是想想这个：一个基因的改变就能够使具有一对翅膀的**飞行动物(苍蝇)**变成具有两对翅膀。

>关于进化速率的问题现在必须被转向一个不同的方向，进化是否是一个渐变的过程，或者它是否是突然发生的？对于包含化石的深厚的岩石结构的细致文献研究才能够给我们提供针对两个对立理论最可能的检验方法。

>有时候，在某一包含丰富化石的岩石层的排列中，我们可以得到针对某一个类型的生物体在长时期中的整体印象。比如PS对于三月初破那个的研究。三叶虫是一种现在已经灭绝的具有分节结构的海洋生物。他们可以提供给我们在一个海洋环境中跨越三百万年的生物进化资料。在这个实验中，八个三叶虫种族的每一个都在身体节数上表明了逐渐发生的变化，基本上在每一个时间阶段里他们的分段数量都会增加1到2段。目前没有观察到明显的变化中断。这个现象使得Sheldon认为在这个时间阶段中，环境状况非常稳定。

>针对不同生物体在不同阶段的相似的并且详尽的研究仍然是必要的。许多研究者认为这种生物从一个物种进化到另一个物种的模式都是可行的。在环境稳定的过程中，缓慢而逐渐的变化是生物进化的规范。当环境不稳定的时候新生物的进化完成会变得快速。但是在我们可以确信这个观点之前，我们仍然需要更多向Sheldon这样的研究。

## 7. Original Passage
A heated debate has enlivened recent studies of evolution. Darwin' s original thesis, and the viewpoint supported by evolutionary gradualists, is that species change continuously but slowly and in small increments. Such changes are all but invisible over the short time scale of modern observations, and, it is argued, they are usually obscured by innumerable gaps in the imperfect fossil record. Gradualism, with its stress on the slow pace of change, is a comforting position, repeated over and over again in generations of textbooks. By the early twentieth century, the question about the rate of evolution had been answered in favor of gradualism to most biologists' satisfaction.

Sometimes a closed question must be reopened as new evidence or new arguments based on old evidence come to light. In 1972 paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge challenged conventional wisdom with an opposing viewpoint, the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis, which posits that species give rise to new species in relatively sudden bursts, without a lengthy transition period. These episodes of rapid evolution are separated by relatively long static spans during which a species may hardly change at all.

The punctuated equilibrium hypothesis attempts to explain a curious feature of the fossil record --- one that has been familiar to paleontologist for more than a century but has usually been ignored. Many species appear to remain unchanged in the fossil record for millions of years --- a situation that seems to be at odds with Darwin' s model of continuous change. Intermediated fossil forms, predicted by gradualism, are typically lacking. In most localities a given species of clam or coral persists essentially unchanged throughout a thick formation of rock, only to be replaced suddenly by a new and different species.

The evolution of North American horse, which was once presented as a classic textbook example of gradual evolution, is now providing equally compelling evidence for punctuated equilibrium. A convincing 50-million-year sequence of modern horse ancestors --- each slightly larger, with more complex teeth, a longer face, and a more prominent central toe ---seemed to provide strong support for Darwin' s contention that species evolve gradually. But close examination of those fossil deposits now reveals a somewhat different story. Horses evolved in discrete steps, each of which persisted almost unchanged for millions of years and was eventually replaced by a distinctive newer model. The four-toed Eohippus preceded the three-toed Miohippus, for example, but North American fossil evidence suggests a jerky, uneven transition between the two. If evolution had been a continuous, gradual process, one might expect that almost every fossil specimen would be slightly different from every year.

If it seems difficult to conceive how major changes could occur rapidly, consider this: an alteration of a single gene in files is enough to turn a normal fly with a single pair of wings into one that has two pairs of wings.

The question about the rate of evolution must now be turned around: does evolution ever proceed gradually, or does it always occur in short bursts? Detailed field studies of thick rock formations containing fossils provide the best potential tests of the competing theories.

Occasionally , a sequence of fossil-rich layers of rock permits a comprehensive look at one type of organism over a long period of time. For example, Peter Sheldon' s studies of trilobites, a now extinct marine animal with a segmented body, offer a detailed glimpse into three million years of evolution in one marine environment. In that study, each of eight different trilobite species was observed to undergo a gradual change in the number of segments --- typically an increase of one or two segments over the whole time interval. No significant discontinuous were observed, leading Sheldon to conclude that environmental conditions were quite stable during the period he examined.

Similar exhaustive studies are required for many different kinds of organisms from many different periods. Most researchers expect to find that both modes of transition from one species to another are at work in evolution. Slow, continuous change may be the norm during periods of environmental stability, while rapid evolution of new species occurs during periods of environment stress. But a lot more studies like Sheldon' s are needed before we can say for sure.
